# 50V-DC-Power-Supply
This project focuses on the design of a 50V high-voltage DC power supply.
The circuit converts AC input into a stable and smooth DC output. Rectifier, filter, and voltage regulator circuits are used to reduce ripple and maintain constant voltage.
The power supply is safe, reliable, and suitable for laboratory and electronic applications.
